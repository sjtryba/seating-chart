# Seating Chart

This app finds AN optimal seating chart for your class room. The app uses a genetic algorithm to find a local optimized seating chart. Student information is loaded through a CSV file, for now. There is a specific format for the CSV file that I don’t want to get into because I intend on having student data input directly into the app.
